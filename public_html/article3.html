    <!-- Start of OOP -->
    <h2><b>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</b></h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a widely popular programming paradigm. This method of structuring a program uses objects that have properties and behaviors. Each programming language handles the principles of OOP a little differently, so it’s important to learn OOP for each language you are learning.</p>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the creation of reusable “objects” that have their own properties and behavior that can be acted upon, manipulated, and bundled.
        These objects package related data and behaviors into representations of real-life objects. OOP is a widely used paradigm across various popular programming languages like Python, C++, and Java.
    </p>
    <p>Many developers use OOP because it makes your code reusable and logical, and it makes inheritance easier to implement. It follows the DRY principle, which makes programs much more efficient.
        In OOP, every object is defined with its own properties. For example, say our object is an Employee. These properties could be their name, age, and role. OOP makes it easy to model real-world things and the relationships between them. Many beginners prefer to use OOP languages because they organize data much like how the human brain organizes information.
    </p>
    <p>The four main principles of OOP are <b>encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.</b></p>

    <!-- End of OOP -->
    <!-- Start of Encapsulation -->
    <h2><b>Encapsulation</b></h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.
    <br/></p>
    <p>We've shown that private class data can only be manipulated via class functions, not objects, in the Fig. 1.1.</p>

    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/encapsulation.png" alt="Act" width="850" height="275">
        <p>Fig. 1.1</p>
    </div>
    <h4><b>Real life example</b></h4>
    <p>The common example of encapsulation is Capsule. In capsule all medicine are encapsulated in side capsule as shown in Fig. 1.2</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/en1.png" alt="Act" width="700" height="275">
        <p>Fig. 1.2</p>
    </div>
    <p><b>Automatic Cola Vending Machine :</b>Suppose you go to an automatic cola vending machine as shown in Fig. 1.3 and request for a cola. The machine processes your request and gives the cola.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/en2.png" alt="Act" width="300" height="350">
        <p>Fig. 1.3</p>
    </div>
    <p>Here automatic cola vending machine is a class. It contains both data i.e. Cola can and operations i.e. service mechanism and they are wrapped/integrated under a single unit Cola Vending Machine. This is called Encapsulation.<br/>

        <b>A Washing Machine and It's Power Button:</b> What is the function that power button does? Switches the machine on (obviously). But did u ever imagined the inside mechanism. Doesn't matter unless it's functioning well. That's encapsulation. The object is wrapped and inner details are hidden. Only thing is that object can be called and used. User friendly!
        You can't access private date outside the class.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Benefits of Encapsulation in Python</b></h4>
    <p>Encapsulation not only ensures better data flow but also protects the data from outside sources. The concept of encapsulation makes the code self-sufficient. It is very helpful in the implementation level, as it prioritizes the ‘how’ type questions, leaving behind the complexities. You should hide the data in the unit to make encapsulation easy and also to secure the data.</p>

    <h4><b>What is the need for Encapsulation in Python</b></h4>
    <p>The following reasons show why developers find the Encapsulation handy and why the Object-Oriented concept is outclassing many programming languages.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation helps in achieving the well-defined interaction in every application.</li>
        <li>The Object-Oriented concept focuses on the reusability of code in Python. (DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself).</li>
        <li>The applications can be securely maintained.</li>
        <li>It ensures the flexibility of the code through a proper code organization.</li>
        <li>It promotes a smooth experience for the users without exposing any back-end complexities.</li>
        <li>It improves the readability of the code. Any changes in one part of the code will not disturb another.</li>
        <li>Encapsulation ensures data protection and avoids the access of data accidentally. The protected data can be accessed with the methods discussed above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Encapsulation in Python is, the data is hidden outside the object definition. It enables developers to develop user-friendly experience. This is also helpful in securing data from breaches, as the code is highly secured and cannot be accessed by outside sources.</p>
    <!-- End of Encapsulation -->

    <!-- Start of Inheritance -->
    <h2><b>Inheritance</b></h2>
    <p>The process of obtaining the data members and methods from one class to another class is known as inheritance. In other words, inheritance is a process by which a child class acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent class.</p>
    <p>The existing class is called parent class (a more general class) and the new class is called child class (a more specialized class). The child class inherits data and behavior from the parent class.</p>
    <p>Fig. 2.1 shows the parent class which is Calculation and Fig. 2.2 shows the child class which is DivideNumber. The class DivideNumber can use all the functions of its parent class which is Calculation.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/parent.png" alt="Parent" width="700" height="250">
        <p>Fig. 2.1</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/child.png" alt="Child" width="700" height="250">
        <p>Fig. 2.2</p>
    </div>
    <h4><b>Basic Terminologies of Inheritance</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In the inheritance the class which is give data members and methods is known as base or super or parent class.</li>
        <li>The class which is taking the data members and methods is known as sub or derived or child class.</li>
        <li>The data members and methods of a class are known as features.</li>
        <li>The concept of inheritance is also known as re-usability or extendable classes or sub classing or derivation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Real Life example</b></h4>
    <p>The real life example of inheritance is child and parents, all the properties of father are inherited by his son as shown in Fig. 2.3</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/in1.png" alt="Act" width="650" height="250">
        <p>Fig. 2.3</p>
    </div>
    <p>Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as a parent-child relationship.</p>

    <h4><b>Benefits of inheritance</b></h4>
    <p>If we develop any application using this concept than that application have following benefits,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application development time is less.</li>
        <li>Application take less memory.</li>
        <li>Application execution time is less.</li>
        <li>Application performance is enhance (improved).</li>
        <li>Redundancy (repetition) of the code is reduced or minimized so that we get consistence results and less storage cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- End of Inheritance -->
    <!-- Start of Poly -->

    <!-- End of Poly -->
    <!-- Start of Abstraction -->
    <h2><b>Abstraction</b></h2>
    <p>In Python, an abstraction is used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity. It also enhances the application efficiency.</p>
    <p>Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."</p>
    <p>Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/abstract.png" alt="abstraction" width="650" height="250">
        <p>Fig. 4.1</p>
    </div>
    <h4><b>Real Life example</b></h4>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/ab1.png" alt="Abstraction" width="650" height="350">
        <p>Fig. 4.2</p>
    </div>
    <p>Suppose you are operating a mobile phone. You know that the important feature of a phone is the memory card, SIM, battery life, design and build, and processor power. But, while operating the phone you do not get into the operational details of the phone such as how the CPU of the phone allocates memory for the various media on your phone or other intricate architectural details of the phone. All these details aren’t visible to cell-phone users from a non-technical background as shown in Fig.4.2.</p>
    <h4><b>Benefits of Abstraction</b></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.</li>
        <li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
        <li>Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- End of Abstraction -->
